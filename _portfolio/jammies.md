## Summary

This project was my first AngularJS based application. The goal for this application was to make a replica of the music playing application Spotify.

## Explanation

This application was all about getting real practice in developing within the AngularJS framework. I chose to work on a project making a replica of the popular music playing application, Spotify, because its popular web application that millions use and has many interesting features.

## Problem

I wanted to develop a web app that could let the user select a song to play from different albums and then be able to control the song via traditional controls as well as move between the album's other songs. This interface is just like what Spotify uses and is very familiar to users ensuring limited learning time from users.

## Solution

In order to solve this problem, I decided to utilize the AngularJS framework. This application was a perfect setup to use AngularJS and allowed me the opportunity to get my hands dirty with concepts like Controllers, Services, and Directives.

## Results

Overall, this implementation was excellent. The results for the users are a well constructed interface that is very familiar and simple to use. The code is well structured, clear, and concise. It is much easier to follow than if another solution, such as jQuery, was used.

## Conclusion

While this project is fairly basic it still provides a great dealing of learning for me as well as a solid platform to expand functionality in the future. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of this application and the topics I learned in creating it. As for AngularJS, I feel this has only whetted my appetite to further explore how I can use this framework on other projects.
