## Summary

This project is a grocery list making application.

## Explanation

I created this application in order to get familiar, practice, and play around with JavaScript UI interactivity and it just so happens that this was also a useful list making application.

## Problem

I wanted to make sure this list was interactive so I included the ability to add items to the list, to delete items from the list, and also to mark through items, signifying that they were already acquired. This application would have to remain on the same page with no page reloads, thus staying as a single-page application (SPA).

## Solution

I utilized JavaScript to get the list to behave as described above. Using JavaScript allowed me to keep the project as a single-page application (SPA) with no page reloads and to also give the user a seamless experience when interacting with the items on the list.

## Results and ## Conclusion

While this was a simplistic application, it was fun to get to use JavaScript to create UI interactivity for something I might actually use.
