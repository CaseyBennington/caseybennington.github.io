Hey There!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that since you are reading this, you would like to learn me about me.

My name is Casey Bennington and I am a problem solver. I have a back ground in accounting, consulting, and web development.
I love being able to solve problems for clients and be able to see their amazing results. Software development is the platform of the future and I am riding the wave.

A "quick" summary of my official education.
I hold a BS and MS in Accounting and Information Systems from Virginia Tech and IT: Database & Program Developer and IT: Web Programmer Certificates from Virginia Western Community College. I also have completed Thinkful's Front-End Web Development course and am currently enrolled in Bloc's Fullstack program.

Fun Fact: I hold the following active licenses CPA, CGMA, CITP, CISA. Let me know if you can figure out what those are!

If you would like to connect, please send me a message via my contact form.

Thanks!
