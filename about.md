###### Hey There!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm going to go ahead and make the assumption that since you are reading this, you would like to learn more about me.

My name is Casey Bennington and I am a problem solver. I have a background in accounting, consulting, and web development.  
I love being able to solve problems for clients and being able to see their amazing results. Web development is the platform of the future and I am riding the wave.  
I recently left the exhilarating world of accounting and consulting to pursue my childhood dreams of being a software developer. It has been a challenging process, but I am very excited for what the future may hold.

A "quick" summary of my official education.  
I hold a BS and MS in Accounting and Information Systems from prestigious Virginia Tech, an IT: Database & Program Developer, and an IT: Web Programmer Certificates from Virginia Western Community College. I also have completed Thinkful's Front-End Web Development course and am currently enrolled in Bloc's Full Stack program.

Fun Fact: I hold the following active licenses CPA, CGMA, CITP, CISA. Let me know if you can figure out what those are!

If you would like to connect, please send me a message via my contact form.

Thanks!
