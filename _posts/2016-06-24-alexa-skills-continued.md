title: Alexa Skills Continued
---
June 24th, 2016

The next step in the Alexa project was to edit another sample to further understand the way you can develop for Alexa and to further get experience with their submission process.

We started with this Space Geek fact skill and I modified it to a Euro 2016 fact skill given its perfect timing right in the middle of the current Euros.

I proceeded with this skill in much the same way as the first. The sample was much less cumbersome to adjust because the logic is much simpler for just a fact spewing skill. The biggest item I noticed for the submission process this time is that the Alexa team did not get to review my skill within my estimated 24-hour window. This longer timeframe (it's still counting at the time of this post) is very disappointing. To think that these complicated skilled cannot be certified for greater than 48 hours is disheartening. Some might say I'm being too harsh, however, I don't think so. There are a great number of items to checkoff the list to ensure compliance and it is quite easy to miss them or implement them incorrectly and not know until after a go at the certification process and if that cycle takes 48+ hours...that's bad.

So, I am finished with the fact skill and am still awaiting certification.
