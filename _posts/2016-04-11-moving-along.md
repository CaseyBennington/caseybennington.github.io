title: Moving Right Along
---
It's been a week already. Seems like time has been flying by now that I'm in this course. I've spent most of this time learning about the Ruby language. It's very new to me and totally different from other languages I've learned so far. It is very much designed with the developer in mind and sometimes that counters strongly with how other languages treat the same topics. But I'm moving my way through it. There's just so much to learn!
