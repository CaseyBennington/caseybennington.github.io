title: Diving into Alexa
---
I've now been working on a custom Alexa skill. I am still trying to utilize some of the templates provided by Amazon to configure my skill, but this skill will be doing something that is not offered by one of their standards templates. A much bigger challenge. There is a lot of interactivity in the Alexa code I need to be aware of as I move forward. It's important to keep in mind the request and response objects that Alexa expects as that can be the biggest tripping point in submitting a skill for certification.

My idea for this skill is mainly for myself, though maybe others might end up finding it useful. I am creating a skill for practicing fast footwork at home for soccer skill development. These skills are meant to be practiced on your own for about 15-20 minutes every day and I think having a voice guide during your training would be a great idea to help keep you on track for move comes next and how long to do each move before changing.

I've written up my intents, utterances, and program flow through the program interaction, though I can easily see myself changing these as I get to testing, especially as I get to see what 'feels' best.

Stay tuned...
